This directory will hold/holds the prototype build for a basic audience response system. It will be built using the following files:

1. Player Class.
2. Host Class.
3. Scripts for polling the database.
4. Scripts for updating values in the database. 
5. Scripts for getting values from the database.

ISSUE WITH CURRENT SYSTEM:
If a host is made, then destroyed before changing state,
there will be no way way to distinguish it later between
new hosts with the same quiz code.
